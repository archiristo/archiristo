### 📊 Research & Logic
> "If you can't explain it to a child, you haven't understood it yet." 
> *But if you're explaining the universe's logic, sometimes a child-like curiosity is all you need.*

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: **Advanced Quantum Mechanics & Formal Logic**.
- 💬 Ask me about: **Stellar nucleosynthesis, Symbolic AI, and why I prefer LaTeX over Word.**
- ⚡ Fun fact: My brain operates on a high-frequency logic and I believe the stars are the ultimate data source.
